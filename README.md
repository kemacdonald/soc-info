Learning versus performing in social contexts

Model, experiments, data, analyses and paper draft for Yoon*, MacDonald*, Asaba, Gweon and Frank (in prep).

## project summary
We are interested in predicting people's action choices based on learning-performing tradeoff in social contexts.
How do people choose between an action that maximizes learning (gaining new information or improving one's skills), 
and an action that maximizes performing (making an overt, rewarding outcome occur)? 
How will their choices change based on their social context, e.g. whether or not there is a person to impress?
