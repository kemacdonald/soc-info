# soc-info
Project looking at learning-performance tradeoff in social active learning contexts.

Model, experiments, data, analyses and paper draft for Yoon*, MacDonald*, Asaba, Gweon and Frank (in prep).

## project summary
Our actions shape what we learn. Because of this dependency, learners are proficient at choosing their actions to maximize their information gain. But learning often unfolds in social contexts where learners have both informational goals (e.g., to learn how something works) but also social goals (e.g., to appear competent and impress others). How do these different factors shape learners' decisions?
