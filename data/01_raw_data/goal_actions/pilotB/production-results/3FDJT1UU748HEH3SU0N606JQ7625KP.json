Also, please note that on December 15th, 2017 amazon forced all users to begin using the new worker site. One of the many changes is the inability for workers to see the \"Auto Approval\" time set by requesters. Many workers use this information to aid in deciding whether or not to do a HIT. Please consider including the Auto Approval time in your HIT descriptions.",
