        "why_action": "I'd know what type of toy it was if I only pulled the handle or pushed the button by itself. If I pulled the handle and it lit up, then pulling the handle impacted the light and the button was music. If pulling the handle by itself turned on music, then the button did light by itself. If nothing happened, then both the handle and light had to be on for something to work. I wouldn't know that if I pressed both at once. ",
