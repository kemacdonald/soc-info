\begin{abstract}
Our actions shape what we learn. Recent work suggests that people engage
in efficient self-directed learning to maximize information gain.
However, human learning often unfolds in social contexts where learners
not only face informational goals (e.g.~learn how something works) but
also social goals (e.g.~appear competent and impress others). How do
these factors shape learners' decisions? Here, we present a
computational model that integrates the value of social and information
goals to predict the decisions that people will make in a simple active
causal learning task. We show that an emphasis on performance or
self-presentation goals leads to reduced chances of learning (E1) and
that social context can push learners to pursue performance-oriented
actions even when the learning goal is highlighted (E2). Our formal
model of social-active learning successfully captures the empirical
results. These findings are the first steps towards understanding the
role of social reasoning in active learning contexts.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Imagine you are a novice cook and you have to decide what meal to
prepare for a first date. Should you choose an easy favorite or should
you attempt to make something new? While the familiar recipe can ensure
a good meal, you may miss out on a new, delicious dish. The new recipe
might taste even better, but it has a higher chance of failure. In such
\emph{explore-exploit} dilemma (Sutton \& Barto, 1998), you can choose
between \emph{exploiting} your previous experience and knowledge to
ensure a good meal (\emph{performance} goal), or \emph{exploring} the
new recipe that may or may not result in a more delicious dish
(\emph{learning} goal). Here, we explore the idea of this
learning-performance goal tradeoff in a simple active learning context,
where social factors may shape the goals we consider.

Active learning occurs when people have control over the sequence of
information in a learning context (e.g.~try pressing buttons on a toy,
one by one, to see their effect). The key assumption is learners will
maximize the usefulness of their actions by gathering information that
is especially helpful for their own learning. Active contexts lead to
faster learning than passive contexts where people don't have control
over the information flow, as suggested by empirical work in education
(Grabinger \& Dunlap, 1995), machine learning (Settles, 2012), and
cognitive psychology (Castro et al., 2009).

But real-world learning usually takes place in rich social contexts with
teachers, peers, or other people who can directly influence our
learning. Indeed, children and adults seem to modulate their inferences
depending on whether evidence is generated on their own or by others
(e.g. Xu \& Tenenbaum, 2007); whether they observe intentional versus
accidental actions (Carpenter, Akhtar, \& Tomasello, 1998); and whether
they believe another person selected their actions with the goal of
helping them learn (i.e.~teaching; Shafto, Goodman, \& Frank, 2012). But
even when we learn from \emph{our} own actions instead of others', our
social environment may affect our self-directed learning process. While
previous models have captured how we optimize learning, either from our
own actions or from others, they have been agnostic to other social
factors that are ubiquitous in a learner's environment. People must
integrate the value of social goals (e.g.~looking competent or
knowledgeable) and information goals when deciding what to do next.

How can active learning models accommodate this richer set of utilities?
As a step towards answering this question, we model a learner who
considers a mixture of learning and performance goals. A key assumption
underlying recent Bayesian models of human social cognition is that
people expect others to act approximately optimally given a utility
function (e.g. Goodman \& Frank, 2016; Jara-Ettinger, Gweon, Schulz, \&
Tenenbaum, 2016). Our model adopts the same utility-theoretic approach,
and assumes an agent who reasons about the utility function that
represents a weighted combination of multiple goals (Yoon, Tessler,
Goodman, \& Frank, 2017) in a social active learning context.

We instantiate our model in a simple causal learning task and examine
how people choose actions that support learning vs.~social goals. We
present a toy with an uncertain causal mechanism (Figure \ref{fig:toy}),
for which doing only one of the two possible actions (handle pull or
button press) is disambiguating but potentially risks no immediate
effect (i.e.~neither sound nor light turning on), while doing both
actions simultaneously is immediately rewarding but is not informative
for learning the toy's causal mechanism. Thus, the learner can choose
between the two actions that will each lead to one outcome (new
discovery; learning) or the other (immediate reward; performance). The
learner's action rests on relative utilities he assigns to exploration
versus exploitation, which in turn are determined in part by the social
context (e.g.~the presence or absence of his
boss).\footnote{From here on, we use a male pronoun for Bob, the learner, and female pronoun for Ann, the boss and observer.}

In two experiments, we show that emphasizing performance or
self-presentation goals leads to actions that are not informative and
thus reduce the chances of learning (E1). Next, we show that the
presence of an observer (i.e., a boss) pushes learners to pursue
performance/presentation actions even when the learning goal is
highlighted (E2). Finally, we show that the empirical results are
consistent with predictions of our cognitive model of social-active
learning.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[tb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figs/model_diagram-1} 

}

\caption[Diagram of the computational model]{Diagram of the computational model. The learner considers possible hypotheses: Toy 1 (handle pull turns on the light, button press turns on music, both actions cause both effects); Toy 2 (handle pull turns on music, button press turns on the light, both actions cause both effects); and Toy 3 (both actions cause both effects, but each action on its own does not produce any effect). The learner also considers his contextual goals. When an observer is absent, he considers his learning goal (to maximize information gain) and performance goal (e.g. to play music) and decides on an action. The learning goal favors a single action (e.g. pull the handle only) that can fully disambiguate, whereas the performance goal favors the both action (pull the handle AND push the button) that guarantees the most salient reward. When an observer is present, his decision for an action is based on his learning goal vs. presentational goal (to have the observer infer his competence or knowledge of how the toy works).}\label{fig:model_diagram}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

We model a learner's action choice based on his goal to learn how a toy
works (\emph{learning utility}), to make the toy perform a function
(\emph{performance utility}), or to present himself as competent and
knowledgeable about how the toy works (\emph{presentational utility};
see Figure \ref{fig:model_diagram}).

\subsubsection{Learning utility}\label{learning-utility}

The \emph{learning utility} symbolizes the goal to learn new
information, which in our paradigm is associated with figuring out how a
given toy works. The learning utility is formally represented by an OED
model (Coenen, Nelson, \& Gureckis, 2017; Lindley, 1956; ``Optimal
Experiment Design''; Nelson, 2005), which quantifies the \emph{expected
utility} of different information seeking actions. The learner considers
the hypothesis space \(H\), and wants to determine the correct
hypothesis. He thinks about the utility of the answer to each possible
query (realized through taking an action), which is equal to the
\emph{information gain}: the change in the learner's overall uncertainty
(difference in entropy) before and after receiving an answer. This
information gain is equal to the expected learning utility
(\(U_{learn}\)):
\[ U_{learn} = U(a) = \frac{ent(H) - ent(H|a)}{log_2n}\] \noindent
where \(ent(H)\) is the Shannon entropy of \(H\), which provides a
measure of the overall amount of uncertainty in the learner's beliefs
about the candidate hypothesis(MacKay, 2003). Once the learner chooses a
query \(Q\), which yields an answer \(a\), then he updates his beliefs
about each hypothesis via standard Bayesian updating. Finally, the
difference in entropy is normalized by \(log_2 n\), where \(n\) is the
number of possible actions, to convert the entropy to a value between 0
and 1.

\subsubsection{Performance utility}\label{performance-utility}

The \emph{performance utility} is the utility of achieving an immediate
rewarding outcome. Within our paradigm, the learner gains utility from
an immediate effect of music or light turning on. The expected
performance utility (\(U_{perf}\)) before the learner chooses an action
is the likelihood of an effect \(m\) given the learner's action \(a\).
\[ U_{perf} = P_L(m | a) \] \noindent

When there is no observer present (\(obs = no\)), the learner considers
the tradeoff between the learning utility and performance utility, and
he determines his action based on a weighted combination of the two
utilities:
\[ U(\phi; obs = no) = \phi_{learn} \cdot U_{learn} + \phi_{perf} \cdot U_{perf} ,\]
\noindent
where \(\phi\) is a parameter governing how much value the learner
places on each goal.

\subsubsection{Presentation utility}\label{presentation-utility}

When there is another person present to observe the learner's action,
this observer \(O\) is expected to reason about the competence \(c\) of
the learner \(L\) which is equal to whether the learner was able to make
the toy produce an effect. The learner thinks about the observer's
inferential process, and the expected \emph{presentational} utility
(\(U_{pres}\)) is based on maximizing the apparent competence inferred
by the observer. \[ P_O(c) \propto P_L(m | a)\] \[ U_{pres} = P_O(c)\]
\noindent

When there is an observer present (\(obs = yes\)), the learner considers
the tradeoff between all three utilities: the learning utility,
performance utility and presentational utility:
\[ U(\phi; obs = yes) = \phi_{learn} \cdot U_{learn} + \\ \phi_{perf} \cdot U_{perf} + \phi_{pres} \cdot U_{pres}\]
\noindent

The learner \(L\) chooses his action \(a\) approximately optimally (as
per optimality \(\lambda\)) based on the expected utility given his goal
weights and observer presence.
\[ P_L(a | \phi, obs) \propto \exp(\lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}[U(\phi; obs)])\]
\noindent

\section{Experiment 1}\label{experiment-1}

In Experiment 1 (E1), we first wanted to confirm that participants would
choose different actions depending on what goal was highlighted. We were
also interested in how people would act when no explicit goal was
specified within the task. Participants were asked to act on a toy with
an uncertain causal mechanism, and were assigned to different goal
conditions: (1) learning (learn how the toy works), (2) performance
(make the toy play music), (3) presentation (impress their boss), and
(4) no goal specified. We hypothesized that participants would choose an
informative action more often in the following order of goal conditions
(decreasing): learning, no goal, performance, and
presentation.\footnote{Our hypothesis, method, model and data analysis were pre-registered prior to data collection on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/kcjau). All experiments, data, model scripts, and analysis codes for the statistical models can be found in the online repository for this project: https://github.com/kemacdonald/soc-info.}

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Method}\label{method}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited 196 participants (45-51 per condition) on Amazon's
Mechanical Turk, with IP addresses in the US and a task approval rate
above 85\%. We excluded 7 participants who failed to answer at least two
out of three manipulation check questions correctly (see Procedure
section for details on the manipulation check), and thus the remaining
189 participants were included in our final analysis.

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design}

We presented images and instructions for three different toys that
looked very similar but worked in different ways (see captions for
Figure \ref{fig:model_diagram}). The instructions conveyed that pressing
the button and pulling the handle was immediately rewarding but
uninformative (fails to disambiguate the causal mechanism). In contrast,
either of the single actions was completely disambiguating, but was
uncertain to produce an immediate outcome. Each toy had a label at the
front, indicating the correct action(s)--outcome link.

We asked participants to act on one of these toys; importantly, the
given toy was missing its label, leading to uncertainty about its causal
structure. We randomly assigned participants into four goal conditions.
In the \emph{No-Goal} condition we did not specify any goal for
participants. In the \emph{Learning}, \emph{Performance}, and
\emph{Presentation} conditions, we asked participants to imagine they
were toy developers and one day their boss approached them. We
instructed participants to: figure out the correct label for the toy
(\emph{Learning}); make the toy play music (or turn the light on;
\emph{Performance}); or impress their boss and show that they are
competent (\emph{Presentation}). We asked participants to select an
action out of the following set: ``press the button'', ``pull the
handle'', or ``press the button and pull the handle.'' The order of
actions was randomized.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

In the \emph{exposure phase}, we showed participants an example toy and
gave instructions for three toy types. We first presented the
instructions for the single action toys (Toy 1 and Toy 2) in a
randomized order, and then presented the instructions for the both
action toy (Toy 3). After instructions, participants indicated what
action would make each toy operate (e.g. ``How would you make {[}this{]}
toy play music?'') to show that they understood how the different toys
worked.

In the \emph{test phase}, participants read a scenario for one of the
four goal conditions, followed by the question: ``If you only had one
chance to try a SINGLE action {[}to pursue the specified goal{]}, which
action would you want to take? You will get a 10 cent bonus \ldots{} if
you {[}achieve the given goal{]}''.

Both before and after the critical action decision trial, we asked
participants to rate the likelihood that the unknown toy was Toy 1, 2,
or 3, which indexed participants' prior beliefs about how the toys were
likely to function and their \emph{belief change} after selecting an
action and observing its effect.

\subsection{Results and discussion}\label{results-and-discussion}

\subsubsection{Action decisions:}\label{action-decisions}

We modeled action decisions using a logistic regression specified as
\texttt{$action \sim goal\_condition$} with the No-goal condition as the
reference category\textbackslash{}footnote\{In all of the analyses for
E1 and E2, we used the \texttt{rstanarm} (Gabry \& Goodrich, 2016)
package to fit Bayesian regression models estimating the differences
across conditions. We report the uncertainty in our point estimates
using 95\% Highest Density Intervals (HDI). The HDI provides a range of
credible values given the data and model. \}. Participants' tendency to
select a ``single'' action varied across conditions as predicted (see
Figure \ref{fig:e1_behav_results_plot}A), with the highest proportion
occuring in the Learning condition, followed by No-goal, Performance,
and Presentation.

Compared to the No-goal condition, participants selected the single
action at a greater rate in the Learning condition (\(\beta\) = 1.28,
{[}0.5, 2.17{]}) and at lower rate in the Presentation context
(\(\beta\) = -1.41, {[}-2.47, -0.4{]}), with the null value of zero
difference condition falling well outside the 95\% HDI, and at similar
rate in the Performance condition (\(\beta\) = -0.53, {[}-1.43, 0.35{]})
with the 95\% HDI including the null.

TODO\_KM: add pairwise comparisons of preformance/presentation and
performance/no-goal.

\subsubsection{Action decision times:}\label{action-decision-times}

We analyzed decision times, which were the latency to make an action
selection as measured from the start of the action decision trial (all
RTs were analyzed in log space), using the same model specification as
action decisions. Figure \ref{fig:e1_behav_results_plot}A shows the full
RT data distribution. Compared to the No-Goal condition (\(M\)= 31
seconds), participants took on on average 12.2 (4.2, 20) seconds longer
to generate a decision in the Learning condition. In contrast,
participants in the Performance and Presentation conditions produced
similar decision times.

\subsubsection{Belief change:}\label{belief-change}

We quantified participants' beliefs about the possible toy designs using
entropy, and belief change was measured as the difference in entropy
before and after selecting an action. We modeled change in entropy as a
function of goal condition and participants' action choices:
\texttt{$entropy\_change \sim goal\_condition + action\_response$} (see
Figure \ref{fig:e1_behav_results_plot}C). Across all conditions, people
who selected the single action showed a greater reduction in entropy
(\(\beta\) = -0.49, {[}-0.64, -0.33{]}, i.e., learned more from their
action. We did not see evidence of an interaction between goal condition
and action selection. However, recall that a larger proportion of
participants selected the single action in the Learning context, so the
probability of learning is higher in this scenario.

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

\section{Experiment 2}\label{experiment-2}

In E1, we confirmed that participants selected different actions
depending on the type of goal emphasized. In E2, our goals were
three-fold: (1) to replicate the results from E1; (2) to manipulate
goals \emph{and} the presence/absence of another person
(social/no-social) independently, allowing us to measure the interaction
between goals and social context; and (3) to compare empirical data with
predictions of our computational model. Our key behavioral prediction
was an interaction: that participants would be less likely to select a
single (more informative) action in the Learning goal and No-goal
conditions when their boss was present. We also predicted a null result:
that the presence of the boss should not affect action decisions in the
Performance condition.

\subsection{Method}\label{method-1}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

Using the same recruitment and exclusion criteria as E1, we recruited
347 participants (42-51 per condition), and 325 participants were
included in our final analysis.

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}\label{stimuli-and-design-1}

The stimuli and design were identical to E1, except we had 7 different
goal \(\times\) social conditions. Goals remained identical to E1;
social context varied depending on whether the boss was present in the
cover story (\emph{social}) or absent (\emph{no-social}). Thus, the
seven conditions were: \emph{Social-learning},
\emph{Social-performance}, \emph{Social-presentation},
\emph{No-social-no-goal}, \emph{No-social-learning},
\emph{No-social-performance}, and \emph{Social-no-goal}. Note that we
did not have \emph{No-social-presentation} condition, because the
presentation goal was defined by presenting oneself as competent to
another person.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}

The procedure was identical to E1.

\subsection{Results and discussion}\label{results-and-discussion-1}

\subsubsection{Action decisions:}\label{action-decisions-1}

We modeled action decisions using a logistic regression specified as
\texttt{$action \sim goal\_condition * social\_context$} with the
no-goal-no-social condition as the reference category. We replicated the
key finding from E1: participants selected a ``single'' action more
often when they were in a context that emphasized a learning goal,
followed by the no-goal, performance, and presentation conditions (see
Fig \ref{fig:e2_results}A). There was a main effect of social context,
with participants being less likely to select the single action when
their boss was present (\(\beta =\) -0.521, {[}-1.005, -0.053{]}).
Finally, there was evidence for a reliable interaction between goal
condition and social context such that the effect of social context was
present in the Learning and No-Goal conditions, but not in the
Performance condition (\(\beta\) \(_{int}\) = 1.163, {[}0.01, 2.312{]}).

\subsubsection{Action decision times:}\label{action-decision-times-1}

We replicated the key decision time finding from E1, with participants
making slower decisions in the Learning context as compared to
Performance/Presentation. On average, participants took seconds to
generate a response in the No-goal condidition and seconds in the
Learning condition. In contrast, decisions were faster in the
Performance (\(\beta\) = -7.78 sec, {[}-14.01, -1.52{]}) and
Presentation (-10.77 seconds, {[}-18.67, -2.73{]}) conditions, which
were similar to one another (see Fig \ref{fig:e2_results}B). There was
no evidence of a main effect of social context or an interaction between
goal condition and social context. Note that here we did not see a
difference in decision times between the Learning and No-Goal
conditions, which is different from the pattern in E1.

\subsubsection{Belief change:}\label{belief-change-1}

Across all conditions, participants who selected the single action
showed a greater reduction in entropy (\(\beta\) = -0.35, {[}-0.45,
-0.24{]}. There was weaker evidence of greater reduction in entropy in
the Learning goal condition (\(\beta\) = -0.12, {[}-0.25, 0.01). There
was no evidence of a main effect of social context and no two- or
three-way interactions between social context, goal condition, and
action choice.

\subsubsection{BDA model-data fit:}\label{bda-model-data-fit}

In our paradigm, participants were instructed to choose an
action\footnote{For action priors, we used a separate prior elicitation task, in which people indicated the likelihood for selecting an action without any background information about possible hypotheses or goals. The results suggested that none of the action choice priors statistically differed from chance. We used mean likelihood for each action choice as baseline priors in our model.}
based on a certain goal. We assumed that the goal descriptions (e.g.
``impress your boss'') conveyed to the participants a particular set of
goal weights \{\(\phi_{learn}\), \(\phi_{perf}\), \(\phi_{pres}\)\} used
to generate action choices. We put uninformative priors on these weights
(\(\phi \sim Unif(0,1)\)) and inferred their credible values separately
for each social-goal condition, using Bayesian data analytic techniques
(Lee \& Wagenmakers, 2014).

The inferred goal weights were consistent with what we predicted (see
Figure \ref{fig:e2_results}D). \(\phi_{learn}\) was at its highest for
no-social learning condition, in which the goal to learn was
highlighted, and there was minimum social pressure. On the other hand,
the \(\phi_{perf}\) and \(\phi_{pres}\) together make up the highest
portion in the presentation condition, with high social pressure to
present competence, compared to other conditions.

We also inferred another parameter of the cognitive model, the
optimality parameter \(\lambda\). We put uninformative prior on the
parameter (\(\lambda \sim Uniform(0,10)\) and inferred its posterior
credible value from the data. We ran 4 MCMC chains for 100,000
iterations, discarding the first 50,000 for burnin. The Maximum A-
Posteriori (MAP) estimate and 95\% Highest Probability Density Interval
(HDI) for \(\lambda\) was 4.79 {[}3.96, 6.2{]}.

The predictions of the action choices according to the fitted learner
model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:e2_results}A (bottom). The model's
expected posteriors over action choices capture key differences between
conditions: the single action was more likely for no-social than social
conditions overall, but not when the performance goal was highlighted.
The model was able to predict the distribution of action responses with
high accuracy \(r^2(21)\) = 0.9.

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

How do social contexts shape active learning? We proposed that people
integrate learning-, performance-, and presentation-oriented goals when
deciding what to do. In two experiments, we showed that people chose
more informative actions when learning goals were highlighted and in the
absence of a relevant social context (no boss present), while they chose
more immediately rewarding actions when performance or presentational
goals were highlighted, especially when a boss was present. When no
explicit goal was specified, people showed behavior that seemed to
reflect a mixture of goals. Our model of social-active learning
successfully captured key patterns in the behavioral data.

This work represents a way to bring active learning accounts into
contact with social learning theories. We used ideas from Optimal
Experiment Design, which models active learning as a process of rational
choice that maximizes utility with respect to information gain, and
Bayesian modeling framework, which formalizes a process of recursive
social reasoning. This step allowed us to include social information
within a formal utility-theoretic framework, building a richer utility
function that represented a weighted combination of multiple goals --
informational and social.

There are limitations to this work that present opportunities for future
work. First, we did not differentiate between performance and
presentation goals in the current model/paradigm. That is, the choice of
doing both actions satisfies both performance and presentational gaols.
Our future work is aimed at enriching the space of actions that people
could take, which can tease apart actions driven by self-presentation.
Second, we used a very particular social context -- the presence of a
boss -- to influence people's action choices. It remains an open
question as to how these results would generalize to other kinds of
observers that hold different goals. One particularly compelling
contrast would be to a teacher who wants the learner to select actions
that help her learn. Third, we limited people to a single action choice.
While this allowed us to get a clean measurement of our goal and social
context manipulations, real-world learning often involves a process of
sequential decision-making that could cause learners to priortize
different goals depending on their own prior actions and/or the
probability of interacting with an observer in the future.

Another interesting open question is how our model could be used to
understand active learning over development. Our framework would in
principle allow us to measure changes in children's goal preferences as
they develop more sophisticated social reasoning and better
meta-cognitive abilities. One prediction is that young children focus on
learning goals earlier in development when they are surrounded by
familiar caregivers who scaffold learning-relevant actions. But as their
social reasoning abilities mature and their social environments become
more complex, children may start to emphasize performance or
presentation goals.

Overall, this work represents a first step to answering these rich
questions that ultimately seek to unify theories on active learning and
social reasoning.
